<h1>IT Security Reviewer: Core Concepts</h1>
<p>At its simplest, IT Security is just about protecting digital information from getting stolen, messed up, or lost. It&#39;s the digital version of locking doors and keeping important papers safe.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Thing: The CIA Triad</h2>
<p>Everything in security really comes back to these three ideas. The <strong>CIA Triad</strong> is the foundation for all of it.</p>
<h3>1. Confidentiality: Keeping Info Secret</h3>
<p>Basically, making sure that only the right people can see the data. It&#39;s all about privacy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example:</strong> My private messages should only be seen by me and the person I sent them to.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How it&#39;s protected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Scrambling data so that only someone with the right key can read it.</li>
<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Things like passwords or permissions that only let certain people view certain files or folders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Integrity: Keeping Info Trustworthy</h3>
<p>This means the data is accurate and hasn&#39;t been tampered with. I need to be able to trust that the information I&#39;m seeing is the real deal.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example:</strong> My bank account balance needs to be accurate. If someone could secretly change it, it would have lost its integrity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How it&#39;s protected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> A cryptographic way to prove that a document hasn&#39;t been altered.</li>
<li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Systems that track every single change made to a document, so you can see the history and revert any unauthorized changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Availability: Making Sure I Can Access My Stuff</h3>
<p>This just means that the information and systems are working and accessible when I need them. It&#39;s no good if my data is safe but I can&#39;t get to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example:</strong> A hospital&#39;s patient records system has to be online 24/7 for the doctors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How it&#39;s protected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Having backup copies of data so if one system fails, another one takes over.</li>
<li><strong>DDoS Protection:</strong> Defenses against &quot;Distributed Denial of Service&quot; attacks, where hackers flood a server with so much traffic that it crashes and becomes unavailable.## The Other Key Ideas (Information Assurance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CIA Triad is the core, but a full security plan (what the prof calls <strong>Information Assurance</strong>) adds a couple more important concepts to the mix.</p>
<h3>4. Authenticity: Proving It&#39;s Really You</h3>
<p>This is all about verification. Making sure the person or thing is who or what it claims to be.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it&#39;s done:</strong> Passwords prove you know something, while <strong>biometrics</strong> (like your fingerprint or face ID) prove you are someone. A <strong>digital signature</strong> is a cryptographic way to prove a document was sent by a specific person and wasn&#39;t faked.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Non-Repudiation: No Take-Backs</h3>
<p>This sounds complicated, but it just means having solid proof that someone did something. They can&#39;t deny sending that email or signing that document later. This is super important for legal and financial transactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it&#39;s done:</strong> Digital signatures and secure timestamps create a permanent, verifiable record that ties an action directly to a person and a specific time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How the Bad Guys Get In (Initial Access)</h2>
<p>So, how do hackers usually get their foot in the door? It&#39;s often by tricking a person, not a computer.</p>
<h3>Phishing: The Classic Scam</h3>
<p>This is the most common one. It&#39;s a fake email or message that looks real, trying to get me to click a bad link or give up my password.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> A more dangerous version where the attacker researches their target (me, for example) and creates a personalized email that seems much more believable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Things to watch out for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;URGENT ACTION REQUIRED!&quot;</strong> - They try to make you panic so you don&#39;t think.</li>
<li><strong>Bad grammar and spelling</strong> - A dead giveaway.</li>
<li><strong>Weird links</strong> - I should always hover over a link to see the real destination address before I even think about clicking it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weak Passwords</h3>
<p>This is a no-brainer. Using easy-to-guess passwords or reusing the same password everywhere is just asking for trouble.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it&#39;s bad:</strong> Hackers use automated tools for <strong>brute-force attacks</strong> (trying millions of password combinations in seconds) and <strong>credential stuffing</strong> (using lists of passwords stolen from other website breaches to see if they work on your other accounts).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Malware</h3>
<p>This is malicious software designed to harm or exploit. It can get onto a system through a phishing link, a fake software download, or even a USB drive. Types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Attach to clean files and spread.</li>
<li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Locks up your files and demands a payment to get them back.</li>
<li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly records what you do.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why This Matters: Real-World Context</h2>
<p>Security breaches are increasingly common and have real consequences. Understanding these fundamentals helps protect your data, your organization, and your digital identity.</p>
