# A Guide to Jobs in Cybersecurity (Simple English)

## Part 1: What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the job of protecting computers, networks, and data from online attackers. Think of it like being a security guard for the digital world. The goal is to keep digital information safe, private, and available when you need it. To do it right, you have to think about three things: the **people** using the tech, the **rules** they follow, and the **technology** itself.

## Part 2: The Main Teams (Attack vs. Defense)

In cybersecurity, companies often have two main teams that work against each other to find and fix security problems.

### The Red Team (The Attackers)

The Red Team is a group of "good guy" hackers. Their job is to act like the bad guys and try to break into their own company's systems. This helps find weaknesses before real hackers can.

- **Main Goal:** Find security holes by attacking the company like a real hacker would.
    
- **What They Do:**
    
    - **Penetration Testing:** They try to hack their own company's systems to see if they can get in.
    - **Vulnerability Assessment:** They look for known security weaknesses.
    - **Social Engineering:** They test if employees can be tricked into revealing passwords or letting them into the building.
    - **Physical Tests:** They might even try to sneak into the office building to see how good the physical security is.

### The Blue Team (The Defenders)

The Blue Team's job is to defend the company against all attacks, including the practice attacks from the Red Team.

- **Main Goal:** Protect the company, find attackers, and kick them out.
    
- **What They Do:**
    
    - **Monitoring:** They watch for suspicious activity 24/7.
    - **Fixing Problems:** When a vulnerability is found, they patch it.
    - **Making Policies:** They create rules and procedures to keep the company secure.
    - **Responding to Hacks:** When a real hack happens, they have a plan to stop the attack and fix the damage.

### The Purple Team (Working Together)

A "Purple Team" isn't really a separate team. It's just a name for when the Red and Blue teams work closely together. The Red Team will show the Blue Team exactly how they broke in, and the Blue Team can then use that information to improve the defenses right away.

## Part 3: Jobs Inside a Security Operations Center (SOC)

A SOC is the command center for the Blue Team. It's where all the security alerts are monitored. Jobs there are usually broken into tiers.

- **Tier 1: The First Responder**
    
    - **Their Job:** They watch a screen full of security alerts all day. Their job is to quickly figure out if an alert is a real problem or just a false alarm. If it's real, they pass it up to Tier 2.
        
- **Tier 2: The Detective**
    
    - **Their Job:** When a real problem is found, these are the people who investigate it. They figure out how the hacker got in, what they did, and how to kick them out.
        
- **Tier 3: The Expert / Threat Hunter**
    
    - **Their Job:** These are the top-level pros who handle the biggest and most difficult hacks. They also actively search for hidden hackers that the security alarms might have missed.

## Part 4: Common Security Tasks

### Checking for Weaknesses vs. Hacking Tests

- **Vulnerability Scan:** This is an **automatic scan** that looks for _known_ problems, like using old software or having a bad setting.
    
    - **Analogy:** It's like walking around a house and making a list of every unlocked door and window.
        
- **Penetration Test (Pen Test):** This is a **manual test** where a person tries to _use_ those weaknesses to actually break in.
    
    - **Analogy:** It's like actually trying to climb through the unlocked window to see if you can get inside and steal something.

### The Steps of a Hacking Test (Pen Test)

A good hacking test follows a clear plan:

1. **Planning:** Figure out what you're going to test and do some homework on the target.
    
2. **Scanning:** Check for ways in, like open digital "doors" or "windows."
    
3. **Breaking In:** Use a weakness to get inside the system.
    
4. **Staying In:** See if you can stay inside the system without being noticed.
    
5. **Reporting:** Write a detailed report that explains exactly how you got in and what the company needs to do to fix it.

## Part 5: The Job Market

Jobs in cybersecurity are growing like crazy.

- **Why?** Because almost every company is online now, there's more data to protect, and hackers are getting smarter every day. This means there's a huge demand for people who can protect that data.

## Part 6: Other Cool Jobs in Cybersecurity

Besides working in a SOC, there are lots of other specialized jobs:

- **Cloud Security Engineer:** Protects a company's stuff that's stored in the cloud (like on Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud).
    
- **Application Security (AppSec) Specialist:** Works with programmers to help them build apps that are secure from the very start.
    
- **Digital Forensics Investigator:** A computer detective. They investigate what happened _after_ a hack, often to help the police.
    
- **Security Architect:** Designs the overall security strategy for a company, making big-picture decisions about how to protect everything.
    
- **Incident Response Manager:** When a company gets hacked, this person leads the team that responds and fixes the damage.
    
- **Security Awareness Trainer:** Teaches employees about security threats and how to avoid them.
    
- **GRC Analyst (Governance, Risk, and Compliance):** You focus on the rules and policies. You make sure the company is following all the security laws and regulations.
