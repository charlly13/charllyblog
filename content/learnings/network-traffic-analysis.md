## Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)

Network Traffic Analysis is the practice of capturing, inspecting, and analyzing data flow across a network to gain visibility into real-time activity.

### Fundamentals

- Baseline normal traffic patterns to detect anomalies.
- Threat hunting for C2, exfiltration, and suspicious behavior.
- Troubleshooting latency and protocol errors.

### Tools

- Wireshark for deep packet inspection.
- Use capture and display filters to focus analysis.
- Follow TCP streams to reconstruct conversations.
