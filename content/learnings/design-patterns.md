title: Design Patterns for Scalable Systems
---

This topic explores common design patterns used to build scalable and maintainable systems: event-driven architectures, CQRS, saga patterns, and caching strategies. Examples include how to model eventual consistency and when to apply each pattern.

Highlights:

- Choose patterns based on trade-offs, not preference.
- Prefer simplicity; introduce complexity only when needed.
- Use observability to validate pattern decisions in production.
