<h1>Introduction to Event Logs</h1>
<h2>Definition and Importance</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Chronological records of significant actions, operations, or occurrences recognized by a software system (OS, application).</p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> Logs are the system&#39;s <strong>audit trail</strong> or <strong>flight recorder</strong>. They are essential for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incident Investigation (reconstructing an attack path).</li>
<li>Compliance and Auditing.</li>
<li>Diagnosis of system errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Endpoint Focus:</strong> Monitoring event logs on endpoints (workstations, servers) is critical because adversaries typically spend the majority of their time trying to achieve objectives on these systems.</p>
<h2>Windows Event Log Categories</h2>
<p>Windows organizes events into several key security and administrative areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Logs:</strong> Tracks audited events, most important for security. Primary source for successful (Event ID 4624) and failed (Event ID 4625) login attempts.</li>
<li><strong>System Logs:</strong> Records OS internal functions, startup/shutdown, and driver/hardware changes.</li>
<li><strong>Application Logs:</strong> Logs events generated by specific installed software (e.g., application crashes, errors).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Log Elements</h2>
<p>Every event log entry is structured with specific data points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level:</strong> Severity of the event (e.g., <strong>Error</strong>, <strong>Warning</strong>, <strong>Information</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Date and Time:</strong> A precise timestamp in the system&#39;s time zone.</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> The component (application, service) that generated the log.</li>
<li><strong>Event ID:</strong> A numerical identifier for the specific operation. <strong>Crucial Note:</strong> Event IDs are <em>not</em> unique across different log categories (e.g., ID 100 in the Application Log is different from ID 100 in the System Log).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Log Correlation and Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correlation:</strong> The process of aggregating, normalizing, and comparing events from multiple logs to stitch together a comprehensive timeline of activity. A single log entry is often meaningless until correlated with others (e.g., a system event paired with a network log).</li>
<li><strong>SIEM Systems:</strong> <strong>Security Information and Event Management</strong> platforms are enterprise solutions designed to ingest, analyze, and correlate logs from across the entire network.</li>
<li><strong>Access Tools:</strong><ul>
<li><code>Event Viewer</code>: The graphical interface for quick checks.</li>
<li><code>Get-WinEvent</code>: The powerful PowerShell cmdlet used for advanced filtering and querying via command line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
