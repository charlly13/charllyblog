# Introduction to Event Logs


## Definition and Importance

**Definition:** Chronological records of significant actions, operations, or occurrences recognized by a software system (OS, application).

**Value:** Logs are the system's **audit trail** or **flight recorder**. They are essential for:
* Incident Investigation (reconstructing an attack path).
* Compliance and Auditing.
* Diagnosis of system errors.

**Endpoint Focus:** Monitoring event logs on endpoints (workstations, servers) is critical because adversaries typically spend the majority of their time trying to achieve objectives on these systems.


## Windows Event Log Categories

Windows organizes events into several key security and administrative areas:

* **Security Logs:** Tracks audited events, most important for security. Primary source for successful (Event ID 4624) and failed (Event ID 4625) login attempts.
* **System Logs:** Records OS internal functions, startup/shutdown, and driver/hardware changes.
* **Application Logs:** Logs events generated by specific installed software (e.g., application crashes, errors).


## Key Log Elements

Every event log entry is structured with specific data points:

* **Level:** Severity of the event (e.g., **Error**, **Warning**, **Information**).
* **Date and Time:** A precise timestamp in the system's time zone.
* **Source:** The component (application, service) that generated the log.
* **Event ID:** A numerical identifier for the specific operation. **Crucial Note:** Event IDs are *not* unique across different log categories (e.g., ID 100 in the Application Log is different from ID 100 in the System Log).


## Log Correlation and Analysis

* **Correlation:** The process of aggregating, normalizing, and comparing events from multiple logs to stitch together a comprehensive timeline of activity. A single log entry is often meaningless until correlated with others (e.g., a system event paired with a network log).
* **SIEM Systems:** **Security Information and Event Management** platforms are enterprise solutions designed to ingest, analyze, and correlate logs from across the entire network.
* **Access Tools:**
  * `Event Viewer`: The graphical interface for quick checks.
  * `Get-WinEvent`: The powerful PowerShell cmdlet used for advanced filtering and querying via command line.
