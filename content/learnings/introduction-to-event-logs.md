## Introduction to Event Logs

Event logs are chronological records of significant actions, operations, or occurrences recognized by a system. They serve as the system's audit trail and are essential for incident investigation, compliance, and troubleshooting.

### Windows Event Logs

- Security logs: authentication and audit events (e.g., Event ID 4624, 4625).
- System logs: OS and driver events.
- Application logs: events from installed software.

### Analysis

- Correlate logs across systems to reconstruct timelines.
- Use SIEMs to ingest and normalize logs.
